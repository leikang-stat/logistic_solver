# logistic_solver
Implement logistic regression solvers using gradient descent and Newton-Rhapson updates. <br />
Main functions could be found logisticSolvers_LeiKang.R. <br />
logistic_regression_Lei_Kang.pdf describes the performance of this solver using two examples: one is real data, another is simulated data
